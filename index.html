  It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after
  breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker
  Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured
  houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs
  through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the
  white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not
  been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning,
  dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession
  of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he
  had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary
  shortcomings.
